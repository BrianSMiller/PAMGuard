<h1>SoundTrap data files</h1>
<h3>SUD Files</h3>
<p>
SoundTrap recorders from 
<a href="https://www.oceaninstruments.co.nz/">Ocean Instruments</a>
 store data in proprietary files called SUD files. See SoundTrap documentation for information on how to 
 extract SUD files from SoundTrap recorders. </p>
 
 <p>Earlier versions of PAMGuard required you to 'inflate' the SUD files into standard wav audio files using 
 the <a href="https://www.oceaninstruments.co.nz/downloads/">SoundTrap Host software</a> before they could be processed.</p>
 <p>The current version of PAMGuard no longer requires this since it can read data directly from the SUD files.</p>
 <p>Inflating SUD files to WAV files generally required between 3 and 5 times as much disk space and could also take 
 a fair amount of time, so not inflating will save both!</p>
 
 <h3>Mixing SUD and WAV files</h3>
 <p>If a SUD file and a WAV file with the same name are in the same folder, then PAMGuard will ignore the SUD file
 and process the WAV file. Note that in this case, PAMGuard will be unable to extract any metadata from the SUD file
 and will not extract SoundTrap Click Detections (see below).</p>
 
 <h3>SoundTrap Click Detector</h3>
 <p>If you are using the SoundTrap build in click detector (see SoundTrap manuals) then the SUD files will also contain 
 detected clicks.</p> <p>See the help page for the <a href="../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/SoundTrapClickDetector.html">SoundTrap Click Detector</a> 
 for information on how to get these clicks from the SUD files into PAMGuard. </p>
